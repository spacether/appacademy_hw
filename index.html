        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 cup of italian breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of butter</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons of capers, in the bottle with the brine</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
      <h3>Cooking the Chicken</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In one bowl add whisked egg, salt and pepper
        </li>
        <li>
          In another bowl, place the breadcrumbs
        </li>
        <li>
          Bread the chicken pieces by bathing them in the egg mix, then reading them in the bread bowl, then setting them aside.
          Make sure to bread both sides of the chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the oil and the butter in a pan, then fry the chicken for 3-5 minutes per side.
          Add more oil as needed. Fry the chicken on medium heat to avoid burning it.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Making the Sauce</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Remove most of the oil from the pan but leave the leftover chicken pieces and browned breadcrumbs for the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add caper brine, but NOT THE CAPERS yet, butter and lemon juice to the pan and heat on low until the sauce is simmering.
        </li>
        <li>
          Taste the sauce. If it is not very lemony add more lemon juice. If it is not very salty, add more salt. If it is not very strong, cook it down until it is stronger tasting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the capers and cook for 1 minute more. If you cook it for longer the capers will get soft which is bad.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drizzle the sauce over the chicken, and eat up!
        </li>
      </ol>
